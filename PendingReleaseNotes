>= 14.2.12
----------

* The ``ceph df`` command now lists the number of pgs in each pool.

* Monitors now have a config option ``mon_osd_warn_num_repaired``, 10 by default.
  If any OSD has repaired more than this many I/O errors in stored data a
  ``OSD_TOO_MANY_REPAIRS`` health warning is generated.  In order to allow
  clearing of the warning, a new command ``ceph tell osd.# clear_shards_repaired [count]``
  has been added.  By default it will set the repair count to 0.  If you wanted
  to be warned again if additional repairs are performed you can provide a value
  to the command and specify the value of ``mon_osd_warn_num_repaired``.
  This command will be replaced in future releases by the health mute/unmute feature.

* It is now possible to specify the initial monitor to contact for Ceph tools
  and daemons using the ``mon_host_override`` config option or
  ``--mon-host-override <ip>`` command-line switch. This generally should only
  be used for debugging and only affects initial communication with Ceph's
  monitor cluster.
